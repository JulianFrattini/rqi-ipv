This repository contains the reanalysis of the empirical study that investigated whether the use of passive voice in natural language requirements specifications has an impact on the domain modeling activity [1]. The authors of the original study disclosed their data at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7499290 and we reanalyze it with both a frequentist and a Bayesian approach.
